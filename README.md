# NewsApp

For this project, I had to implement a News feed app which gives a user regularly updated news from the internet related to a particular topic.

Each list item on the main screen displays relevant text and information about the story. 

Clicking on a story opens the story in the user's browser.

App queries the content.guardianapis.com API to fetch news stories related to the topic. 

Networking operations are done using a Loader.
